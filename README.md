# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We built a web application that will generate a random or user-defined book cover that can then be saved in the DOM. The application solves that problem by taking input from the 'Create Book Cover' form, or input randomly generated from the covers, titles, descriptors arrays, and passing it into a new object instantiation of the Cover class. The saved cover page displays saved mini book covers so the user can access them. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. Go to repo on Github [(https://github.com/jacobzimmer47/romcom-pair)]
2. Click Fork > Create New Fork
3. Click Code
4. Copy the SSH url provided by GitHub
5. In the terminal, navigate to the new project repository
6. Type `git clone` and paste the URL
7. Open the repo in text editor
8. Type `open index.html` in the terminal
9. Manipulate the application in the browser window

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We probably invested between 25 and 30 hours, collectively.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
Jake Zimmer [(https://github.com/jacobzimmer47)]
Justen Anderson [(https://github.com/justenanderson-commits)]

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
- Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Write code collaboratively

To accomplish these learning goals we utilized the Terminal, VS Code, Slack, Zoom, and Google Chrome, in addition to a host of web-based resources for conducting research.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

Wins:
- We completed the assigned iterations
- We both leared a ton
- We worked well together

Challenges:
- The Git was very challenging, especially because Git always wanted to default to the Turing-School repo instead of the forked repo that Jake created for us. We probably sent 25 pull requests to Turing school (instead of sending them to one another).
- Creating and navigating between branches in the terminal.
